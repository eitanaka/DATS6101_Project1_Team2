# DATS6101_Project1_Team2
This repository is for project 1 of team 2 in DATS6101-11 intro to data science.

Attached are some notes on collaborating on Github that I learned from a senior programmer.

"""
When collaborating on GitHub, it's important to take a few things into consideration to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow:

Clearly define roles and responsibilities: Make sure everyone on the team knows what they're responsible for and what their specific tasks are.

Establish a communication plan: Regular check-ins and updates can help keep everyone on the same page and minimize confusion.

Use pull requests and code reviews: These features allow you to see changes made by others before they are merged into the main branch. This can help catch bugs and ensure that everyone is following the same coding standards.

Keep the repository organized: Use meaningful commit messages, file and folder names, and labels to help keep the repository organized and easy to navigate.

Use branches: Branches allow you to work on different parts of the project simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. This can help prevent conflicts and keep the project organized.

Keep the code secure: Be mindful of sensitive information and follow best practices for securing your code and data.

Stay up to date: Regularly pulling changes from the main repository and keeping your local copy updated can help prevent conflicts and ensure that everyone is working with the latest version of the code.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure a smooth and productive collaboration experience on GitHub.

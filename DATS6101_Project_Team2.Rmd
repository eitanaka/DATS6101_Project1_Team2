```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r health}
library(readr)
ei_dir <-"/Users/eitanaka/Documents/GitHub/DATS6101_Project1_Team2/dataset/geographic_health_disparities.csv"
henty_df <-"~/Henry/Education/George Washington University/2023 Spring/DATS 6101 Introduction to Data Science/Git/DATS6101_Project1_Team2/dataset/geographic_health_disparities.csv"
ish_dir <- "D:\GWU_ MS in Data Science\Sem1\DATS 6101- Intro to Data Science (64377)\Github\DATS6101_Project1_Team2"
geo_health_df <- read.csv(ei_dir)
geo_health_df
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
